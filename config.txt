# As per the "shell" convention, anything following a hash sign is a comment and should be ignored. The 
# configuration file shall not exceed 100 Kb in size. The configuration file consists of 3 sections. Each section
# is delimited by one or more blank lines. The first section configures the number of nodes in the system. The
# second section configures the hostname of the nodes and the ports on which the nodes will listen for incoming
# connections. The third section contains a list of tokens and the paths which they are required to use to
# traverse through the system.
#
#
# Number of nodes and netID
# 
# The first uncommented line shall consist of an integer followed by a string. The integer shall be the number of
# nodes in the system (hereafter referred to as n), and the string shall be the netID used to login to the dcXX
# machines.
#

# shall be numbered by integers in the range [0, n-1]. The first token shall be an integer, which consists of the 
# unique ID for the node. The second shall be a string, which is is the hostname on which your program for the node
